Reason and objectives of exercise
===
This is an exercise of trying to create RESTful APIs With the team and with NodeJS and MongoDB. We decided with the team to work on the mongodb database, because we never had a chance to use it before.

In this exercise I tried to make it work on my own before we tried as a team.

How to set up
----
Make sure that you've installed mongodb

```
git clone git@github.com:GBouffard/makermix_test.git
cd makermix_test
npm install
``` 

How to run tests
